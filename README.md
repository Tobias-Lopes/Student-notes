# Student-notes

In a school, students' final averages are stored in a vector whose order is that of the class roll call. Students with an average greater than or equal to 7.0 are approved, greater than or equal to 5.0 and less than 7.0 are in recovery, and below 5.0 are failed. Write a program that reads the number of students n in the class, and then their average nnn.
